General Comments / Release Notes   

If you were going to come up with a list of perfect pairings, Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre & Emmanuelle Seigner (actress, singer) might not come to immediate mind, but they should. A druggy, sexy and perfectly crafted debut album, with flashes of Velvet Underground brilliance, the reference is obvious (VU & Nico), but well-suited. One of my favorite records of the year, I'll be listening to this one for forever.

From Label:
"A stellar combination of the talents of The Brian Jonestown Massacre’s Anton Newcombe, cinematic femme fatale Emmanuelle Seigner and ice-cool pop provocateurs The Limiñanas (Lionel and Marie Liminana), L'Epee transcend artistic and traditional borders.

Their creative energy has been channelled into their extraordinary debut album. Named in tribute to Mario Bava’s 1968 cult classic ‘Danger: Diabolik’, it’s a musical masterclass where elements of garage, ye-ye, sleaze rock, cult soundtracks, sci-fi, spaghetti westerns and girl-group pop noir are combined with the cut-and-thrust zeal of a band bursting with ideas and energy. All delivered by Emmanuelle in a sultry Gallic drawl which will send a frisson of recognition through anyone familiar with her iconic roles in, among many others, Frantic, Venus In Fur and Bitter Moon (all directed by her husband, Roman Polanski)."
