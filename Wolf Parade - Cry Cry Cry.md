Canadian indie-rockers return after 7 years with their 4th studio album. Big indie chamber-power-pop sound punctuated by Spencer Krug's oddly pleasant baritone yodel-wailing. Bright and energetic. A good whole album listen, with a couple of standouts. 

RIYL: Handsome Furs, Psychedelic Furs, Broken Social Scene, Deerhunter, Spoon

**FCCs: 11**   

**Favorites: 1,3**    

1. "Lazarus Online" (3:26) – Driving repetitive piano riff dominates. Gothy, even a bit Sisters of Mercy. Weepy, Psychedelic Furs vocals makes me love this song. 
2. "You're Dreaming" (3:39) – Spoonish organ Intro. Pop-y and bouncy without being annoying. Candidate for the "Pretty in Pink" remake soundtrack. 
3. "Valley Boy" (3:39) – Epic feel to this song. Starts off a bit like an off-canter aping of Tom Petty's "American Girl," and you expect it to develop in the same way, but it goes in a different direction, which makes it great! Up-tempo, epic, vast, catchy. Great tune. Play it. 
4. "Incantation" (4:23) – Tribal rhythm, piano-driven uptempo goth-pop rocker. A chaotic, abrupt climactic ending.
5. "Flies on the Sun" (3:43) – Wavy bright guitars punctuated by sharp cymbal heavy rhythm. Bowie-esque, in a way. 
6. "Baby Blue" (6:00) – Great soaring Hammond organ intro, reinforced by a great uptempo syncopated rhythm. Intense to the end. 
7. "Weaponized" (6:40) – Piano driven uptempo rocker, slows to a midtempo Pink Floydesque piano refrain at ~3:20. Remains at the slower pace, rising to a crescendo ending. 
8. "Who Are Ya" (3:44) – Immediate and abrupt vocals on top of proggy sounding rhythms and instrumentations. Nice organ/horn accompaniment. 
9. "Am I an Alien Here" (3:36) – Quiet keyboard quickly give way to sharp rhythmed midtempo GBVish indie power pop. Ethereal guitar and keyboard accompaniments, throughout. 
10. "Artificial Life" (3:48) – uptempo beginning reminds me of The Cars with it's keyboards right upfront until they give way to the staccato Clash-reggae choppy guitar. 
11. "King of Piss and Paper" (4:48) – FCC "piss" "fucking" etc... Nice spacey NASA sounds and chaotic, crashy drum fills.
