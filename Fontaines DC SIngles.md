!!!ATTENTION PROLETARIAT OF THE GIG ECONOMY! YOUR ANTHEMS HAVE ARRIVED AND THEY ARE PURE, PREMIUM F&%$ING ROCK&ROLL!!!

Good lord, there's something about Glasgow. There's not much else to say. These kids will either burn out or be the next Clash. 

FCCs: None, nada 

RIYL: The Strokes, Wire, Killing Joke, Little Richard, The Clash, perfectly executed rock songs,... hearing the next big thing, first. 

Play: all of them. Can't stop listening to #3

2. Too Real ***** [4:08] - Uptempo, urgent, repetetive and brilliant. Almost R.E.M.-like at first, but then it's all in. Chaotic, panning Sonic Youth guitars over driving beat. "I'm about to make alot o' money... Is it too real 4 ya?"
3. The Cuckoo Is A-Callin' ****** [2:11] - My current song on obsessive repeat. Loopy slide guitar, bouncy uptempp rhythms and something Jam-like in the deceptive simplicity of the tune. Just greatness. "You'll surely take those jabs they throw and drink them like red wine..." Entirely too brief. 
8. Chequeless Reckless (Darklands Version) [2:18] Droning and authoritative uptempo venting. Wire comes to mind. "Money,... is the sandpit of the soul." Greatness.
9. Boys in the Better Land (Darklands Version) ***** [4:26] - Uptempo, tamborine-laden galloping, swaggering deep-throated wall-of sound, anthemic, everything but the kitchen sink perfection
4. Hurricane Laughter (Darklands Version) ***** [4:50] - Uptempo, driving, trancey, repetetive, baddass droning rock&roll. Fantastic Jim Morrison-narrative growling lyrical styling. 
5. Winter in the Sun (Darkland Version) ***** [3:05] - Anthemic, blue-collar and perfect. Driving uptempo. Top-down, driving down the 1, blasting on 11 good. 
6. Liberty Belle (Darkland Version) [2:39] - The car commercial song and I mean that in th ebest way possible, but I swear to god you'll hear it in a VW ad, eventually. This song was built in a lab to be played while driving 80 MPH down 280 on a Sunday with noone else on the road. Young, fast, sleek, crashing, all f*&^ing in rock&roll. 
7. Rocket to Russia (Darklands Version) ***** [2:47] - The good stuff. Little Richard, Beatles, Ramones, Sonics it's all there. Uptempo, pure r&r.
8. Big ***** [1:45] - Uptempo, jangling, angry, rilling, kicking angry defiant and declarative, "But, I'm Gonna Be Big!" Yes, young man, you are.
