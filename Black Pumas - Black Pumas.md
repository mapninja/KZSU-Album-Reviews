Tracks:  

1. **** Black Moon Rising 03:41	- Begins with a drum roll, as if to say "Here comes the R&B Circus." Midtempo head nodder with a great groove, and Barton's stellar vocals and falsetto riffs it's way through a slinky masterpiece. "All she want's to do is groove, right on baby..." You'll be singing this one for years.  
2. **** Colors 04:06 - Killer little acoustic guitar riff starts off with a jangle, breaks into a killer rim-shot rhythm and doesn't let go of you. Soulful, new, retro. Midtempo, handclaps, backup vocals are great. A couple of great little interludes make this one more complex that you might expect.  
3. *** Know You Better 04:09	- Veering into Marvin Gaye territory with instrumentation and arrangement. Sweet and smooth, with a killer highhat rhythm, spare use of reverbed guitar reminiscent of Isaac Hayes "Walk on By" highlights moments. 
4. **** Fire 04:06	 - mid-Uptempo, foot stomping booty shaker from the get-go. Horns and a stacatto rhythm punctuate a killer set of phrasings and lyrical flights. And, that killer guitar riff in the refrain. 
5. *** OCT 33 04:49	- 12 string guitar strumming intro gives way to midtempo 70's production with strings, etc... nods to Otis with the Fa, Fa, Fa,... and Mayfield's Cinematic flair.   
6. *** Stay Gold 04:35 - This mid tempo groove has a Marvin Gaye flavor to it. Burton shows fantastic range, from Baritone to Falsetto. 
7. *** Old Man 03:17	- Mid to uptempo. Addictive little guitar riff and highhat rhythm, throughout.  
8. *** Confines 03:09 - Mid to uptempo with great keyboard work and a great/spare guitar solo. 70's radio perfection.  
9. *** Touch The Sky 04:27	- Great intro with dirty little acoustic blues guitar breakdown, slides into satin sheets with the rest of the instrumentation. Great brass.   
10. Sweet Conversation 03:22 - Slow tempo, Acoustic and pastoral. Birds chirping, light clicks and slapas for rhythm. Reminiscent of the simple acoustic tunes Bob Marley would throw down every once in a while.
