General Comments / Release Notes  

20 year old from Amsterdam's debut album.   Riding a wave of great female fronted rock bands, this is competent and uncomplicated indie guitar pop.



FCCs: None

RIYL: Honeyblood, Courtney Barnett, Adult Mom

Play: 1, ** 6 ** ,7,10

Tracks:  
1. *** Daddy Issues 04:25 - Perfect, driving, bouncing uptempo guitar-driven indie pop song. Play it.	 
2. Don't Make It Difficult 03:38	- More driving uptempo guitar pop, this one with a dark tone to it.   
3. Say It 04:39 -  Mid-uptempo with a sweeter tone, still a bit of melancholy.  
4. Tired 03:35 - Upbeat, jangler. 	 
5. Bedhead 04:00	 - Another jangly upbeat guitar pop song. Sweet and bouncy.   
6. **** Tinfoil 04:45	- midtempo, cool, dark, brooding & droning. Verges on shoegaze. Great vocals, killer guitar hook, trance inducing rhythm. My favorite track on the album. Just a really great sound to this song.  
7. *** Ruby 03:37 - Bouncing again. Another pleasant guitar pop song. This one has a Courttney Barnett feel.  
8. Set of Stairs 02:53	- Another midtempo guitar rocker. Not a standout.   
9. Sorry 03:36 - Repetetive and urgent. Lyrics and vocals are nice, but overall mediocre.	 
10. *** Aha 04:20 - Starts quiet with a nice melancholy vocal hook, reaches crescendo and approaches some My Bloody Valentine sonic territory for the remainder.
