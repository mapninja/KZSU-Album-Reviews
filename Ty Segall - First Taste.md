General Comments / Release Notes  

Fuzzed out, but less dependent upon a wall of guitar than usual. Lots of sonic experimentation and phase shifting results in, well, a Ty Segall album. He released 4 last year, and they just keep coming. Thank goodness. 

From Bandcamp: "A first taste of Ty? Hardly, but First Taste erects extreme new sonic skylines for Segall to soar over. His natural state of urgency is paired with a thirsty contemplative vibe as Ty examines both sides now, twisting some of his best songs and production wack into hard left turns both sweet and hot."

Tracks:  1,2,3,10

1. *** Taste (03:36) - Running with the Devil-sounging intro.  
2. Whatever (04:24) - Funky Dr. John sounding rhythms start off this midtempo swamp psych rocker. Buzzy with horn flourishes. 
3. ** Ice Plant (03:33) - A Capella, with backing vocal aaahhhs. Spare and lovely. "Let your love rain down on me..." refrain fades to quiet, then distant upright piano sneaks at the end. Let it play!  
4. The Fall 02:57 - Uptempo, tribal rhythm rocker. Fuzzed out with keyboard/orchestral backing gives a vaguely South Asian sound.  
5. I Worship the Dog 03:34	 - slow to midtempo. Off-kilter rhythm starts off with fuzzy undertones and Ty's screamy reverbed to space vocals. Killer digeridoo sounds (probably not dig, but that's what they sound 'like').
6. The Arms (03:30) - Nice mandolin intro. Midtempo, 60's psych throwback with fuzzed out acoustic instrumentations and vocal self harmonies. 
7. When I Met My Parents Pt. 1 (01:03) - Surf-rock rhythm 70's SF crime drama theme song with phaseshiftingends abruptly. 	
8. I Sing Them (free) (02:39) - Opens with acoustic lead guitar riffs. Reminiscent of Led Zeppelin, a bit. 	
9. When I Met My Parents Pt. 3 (02:15) - Bleep blipping intro gives way to fast paced tribal driving beat. Abruptly cuts to acapella self-harmony lyrics. Abruptly combines the two. Killer head-banger. 
10. *** Radio (03:50) - The single. Cascading sitar-styled guitar work with Segall's signature tribal/trance rock beat.
11. Self Esteem (05:03) - Stairstepping guitar plucking lead, puctuated by cacaphony that Ty Segall does so well. Phaseshifting whisper growls. Great lead guitar part comes in towrd the end. Gives the impression of carnival music, somehow. Maybe it reminds me a little of Mr. Bungle?	
12. Lone Cowboys (04:32) - slow to midtemp, starts quiet and soft with Ooh lalalas and light organ. Shifts to a fast-pased punk sitar-style guitar strummer. Songs vaguely like the Hawaii Five-0 theme song at the end.
