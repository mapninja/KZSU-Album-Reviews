Bloody Nose is the first single by Oakland-based The Pleasure Routine since their 2016 debut "Sugar Mountain" which was and remains one of my favorite Bay area releases of teh last few years. Produced by Ricky Maymi (Brian Jonestown Massacre) & Tyler Green (Lumerians). Mixed by James Aparicio (Grinderman, Spiritualized). Engineered by Kirk Jacob and Tyler Green.
Musical competence beyond the age of the band and Jackson's unique atonal bartone (think: Stuart Staples of Tindersticks) make for a sound that is unique, familiar and craveable. 

FCCs: none

RIYL: The National, Tindersticks, The Bad Seeds, Gallon Drunk, The Fall

Play: all 


1. Bloody Nose (3:46) - Midtempo. simple, insistent guitar riff gives way to an offbeat rhythm. Loping and pleasant tune floats over the top, while Jackson alternates between his insane off-key and speaking vocals. Great first follow up to the debut album.
2. Ruins (Live at KZSU Wednesday Night Live) (4:55) - Slow, plodding and soulful. Killer harmonica, not present on the studio version. Lauren Kopp's vocals are excellent. 
3. Two Artists (Live at KZSU Wednesday Night Live) (5:28) - My favorite cut, both from the Sugar Mountain release, and the live show at KZSU. Uptempo, chaotic and driving post-punk masterpiece. Great crescendo wall of noise ending.
