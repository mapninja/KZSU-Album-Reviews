General Comments / Release Notes  

She Keeps Bees deliver a follow up to the powerful Eight Houses, five years in the making. Larabee's Appalachian gospel vocal stylings are still laced with the quiet intensity and spare arrangements that demand attention. Less about the raw and pwerful juxtoposition of guitar against Larabee's vocals, instrumentation moves back a bit and floats with her ethereal delivery. Those hoping for the kind of goosebumps inducing musical crescendo of Larabee's quiet, but molten, vocals on Dig On and Eight Houses may be disappointed, but those able to get past into this new feather down sound, will find the same biting and introspective lyrics.
