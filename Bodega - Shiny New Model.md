General Comments / Release Notes   

Sardonic, sarcastic and cheeky, manifesto-driven Art Rock, gritty with pretense. Smart and challenging lyrics, with a clear interest in the craft of production. Their debut, last year's Endless Scroll (produced by Parquet Courtsâ€™ Austin Brown), was one of my favorites of the year, and I still enjoy listening to it, start to finish. This EP is just as excellent, if too brief.

Tracks:  
	
1. **** Shiny New Model 02:48 - Uptempo power pop anthem. Killer beat, self-referential lyrics and that "Swipe" punctuating the chorus. Killer song. Play this.  
2. **** Treasures Of The Ancient World 03:07 - Another great song. Punchy and uptempo, with an angry Beach Boys-ish timbre, somehow. Great bassline and guitar on this one.  
3. *** No Vanguard Revival 01:11	- Fast and urgent. Love the guitar on this one.  
4. Knife On A Platter 02:23 - Midtempo. The beginning of this one reminds me of The Fixx for some reason, but not in a bad way. 80's beat, with Robotic yelling.
5. *** Domesticated Animal 01:41	- Cool goofy uptempo Devo-esque beat, talk-singing female vocals, with rapid-fire guitar in the back of the room. Head nodder.
6. Realism 00:56	 - Great little tune about printing digital pics to tear them up in anger. 
7. **** Truth 03:33 - Another uptempo and punchy power pop anthem. "Truth's not punishment..." Guitar sounds a bit like The Edge, before U2 got rich. Greatness.
