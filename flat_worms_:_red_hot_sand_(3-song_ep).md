3-Song EP

From Cultureaddicts.com: "Los Angelesâ€™ newest punk trio, Flat Worms, is nothing short of a powerhouse. The trio consists of members from such renowned acts as: Thee Oh Sees, Ty Segall, Kevin Morby, and Dream Boys." [HaHa, I didn't see this review until after I reviewed the songs, below]

Favorites: All Three

1. "Red Hot Sand" 5:29 Up tempo, cybmal crashing, driving rocker. Reminds me a bit of The Fall, and Thee Oh Sees?
2. "Petulance" 2:12 Driving art punk rocker. Are we sure these aren't Thee Oh Sees?
3.  "Sovereignty" 1:25 Another fast paced punky mosher. Brief, but great.
