General Comments / Release Notes  

Teens from Brisbane Australia, one the son of Go-Betweens founder Robert Forster, deliver brilliant chamber-pop songs of insecurity, hesitation, misunderstanding and other teen/adult troubles. Moments of melodic brilliance everywhere that echo the likes of David Gedge & Wedding Present, or Stephen Merrit & Magnetic Fields. Fantastic arrangements and production, deceptive in their simplicity. Are these kids really only 19? This is a brilliant album.

Tracks:  
1. **** Make Time 4 Love (02:09)	- Mid to Uptempo acoustic guitar rocker. That Wedding Present sound, right from the starting gate. Nice strings over the top at the chorus. More cowbell.  
2. *** Love Lost (03:04) - Midtempo lament to trying to be someone for someone else. More great strings/organ over the top and great talk/sing lyrical arrangement. Castanets are a cool add. More castanets.  
3. ** She Knows 02:32 -  Uptempo rocker reminds a bit of The Jam, Buzzcocks and that type of intensity.  
4. Losing Myself 02:45 - Midtempo, great lyrics and Male/Female vocals. Deceptively simple and teen sounding without being trite.  
5. Somewhere In Between 01:00 - Brief, muffled GBV-like piano and voice. pleasant.  
6. ** Strange Light 03:22	- Slow and soft strumming acoustic guitar with female vocals remids a bit of Tindersticks with the bassline bobbling underneath.  
7. ** Sleep EZ 03:02 - Midtempo GBV insistent guitar stylings. David Gedge style vocals really show through, here. Cool off-kilter guitar solo.  
8. ** We Can't Win 03:13 - Slow to Midtempo drum machine intro, with soft piano eventually leads to a soft Smiths-like strummer. Melancholy lyrics. Female and Male vocals on this one.    
9. ** A Few Times Too Many 02:59	- Uptempo. Another Jam-like mod-punk tune with bass and drums really driving the arrangement. Have I mentioned the lyrics and delivery remind me of David Gedge? Play this one before or after something from Wedding Present's Watusi album.  
10. Now You Pretend 01:17 - Quiet piano and vocal piece. SPare and melancholy.  
11. *** Get Out 02:18 - uptempo. More Cowbell. Another gret Wedding Present song they never wrote or recorded.  
12. ** Til The End 02:05 - Midtempo, soft strummer with great F/M vocal duet. Follow with Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile.
