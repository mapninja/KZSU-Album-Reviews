Fourth Studio album from King Tuff. Lots of great spaceship sounds and ethereal psych SFX on top of solid songwriting and performance. This is a great Summer Jam, from start to finish that will have you singing along pretty quickly. Put the top down and crank it down the 1. 

FCCs: 5

RIYL: Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, King Gizzard...

Play all but #5 (FCC) 

Particular favorites are:1,**2**,*9*


1.	* "The Other"	6:09 - Down-tempo acoustic with spacey effects and accompaniment. Starts with chiming little bells and church organ. Breathy quiet and excellent lyrics, throughout. 
2.	*** "Raindrop Blue"	4:37 - Mid-tempo funky steady rocker. Starts with a killer bass riff, maintains that with sax, driving beat, falsetto choruses and spacey accompaniments. Booty shaker. Current favorite track.
3.	"Thru the Cracks"	3:36 - Mid-tempo strummy jangle psych-pop with Phil Spector style backing vocals. Nice theremin-style guitar, throughout. 
4.	*"Psycho Star"	4:41 - Great shuffling beat on this mid tempo dance number. Clean clear lyrics. Builds to a great crescendo of backing v
5.	FCC! **"shit"** "Infinite Mile"	3:12 - Great thumping acoustic rocker with harmonica accomp. Too bad it's FCC. Great tune. 
6.	"Birds of Paradise"	4:27 - Up tempo with a 70's cop show flare.
7.	"Circuits in the Sand"	2:59 - Mid to uptempo acoustic strumming ballad-ey lament of modern tech world. Might have ripped the melody from Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive." Might not have, but you'll never unhear it, now. 
8.	"Ultraviolet"	4:22 - Killer fuzzy riff starts off this mid tempo foot stomper. Howls and languid rhythms give this a spooky feel. 
9.	**"Neverending Sunshine"	3:40 - Spaceship taking off SFX and a killer beat with more 70's cop keyboard work. This is the summer hit. Danceable and great.
10.	"No Man's Land"	5:53 - Languid arcing guitar solo starts this low to mid tempo closer. Stays mellow
