There's something wrong with Robert Pollard. This is his 4 millionth release. This year.

Original Release Info: Following GBV's sprawling double-album Zeppelin Over China, Robert Pollard has written and recorded another full-length in record-breaking time. It's Warp and Woof (April 26, 2019), exuberantly barreling through 24 songs in just 37 minutes with a brevity similar to mid-90s GBV albums Alien Lanes and Vampire On Titus. GBV kicked this one out in a flash, recorded in studios, club soundchecks, hotel rooms and even in the tour van.

FCCs: none

RIYL: GBV, perfect pop rock songs, brevity

Play: Everything. 


1.   Bury The Mouse 	1:30 - Mid tempo head nodding rocker with Pollard's trademark singing from inside a coffee can. 
2.   Angelic Weirdness	1:31 - Mid-tempo, super lo-fi acoustic power chords and pots and pans rhythm gives way to a little higher quality about 45 seconds in. Repetitive with a little flourish at the end.
3.   Foreign Deputies	1:01 - slow, single electric guitar picking and pollard a cappella. nifty little John Wayne sample at the end. 
4.   Dead Liquor Store	1:31 - Rapid fire tiny little rocker, changes pace completely at 1:00 then briefly returns. 
5.   Mumbling Amens	   1:54 - Starts quiet and slow tempo. Mid-tempo and somber. 
6.   Cohesive Scoops	1:31 - Strummy and jangly, mid to uptempo. Catchy refrain.  
7.   Photo Range Within	   1:14 - Uptempo, Bouncy and fun.  
8.   My Dog Surprise	1:39 - Wide and crashy. Echoey and goofy sounding vocals. A bit kooky. 
9.   Tiny Apes	1:08 - Brief, uptempo and staccato.
10.  Blue Jay House	2:03 - Uptempo, driving and sounds like vintage GBV.  
11.  Down The Island	1:37 - Ethereal, jangly and airy. A bit quiet and slow to mid-tempo. 
12.  Thimble Society	1:44 - Mid-tempo with killer opening riffs. Upright and anthemic.
13.  My Angel 	1:28 - Driving and catchy. With cowbell. I like the staccato lyric styling. 
14.  More Reduction Linda	1:33 - Uptempo riffage and tom tom rhythms. With either playground  Nice harmony in the chorus.  
15.  Cool Jewels And Aprons	1:25 - Driving and well developed uptempo rocker. Beginning riff reminds me of an Echo &T Bunnymen tune, somehow. 
16.  Even Next	1:40 - slow, acoustic picking and simple snare rhythm. Strings accompany. 
17.  It Will Never Be Simple	2:32 - A sprawling mid-tempo acoustic epic compared to the rest of the album. Jangly and with a nice melody over the top. Fades out rather quickly.
18.  The Stars Behind Us	1:23 - Familiar driving drum beat and fuzzed out rhythm and lead guitars, give way to epic crashiness and a noisy ending. 
19.  Skull Arrow	1:04 - Fast-paced driving acoustic rhythm guitars. Silly Robert Pollard
20.  Out Of The Blue Race	1:22 - Slow-tempo, but rocking insistent, plodding and marching. Another anthemic Pollard special. 
21.  Coming Back From Now On	1:53 - Live or mock-live rhythm shifting rocker. Mid-tempo with great drums, changes pace at about 30 second  intervals. Nice Eddie Van Halen lead at the end. 
22.  The Pipers, The Vipers, The Snakes   1:48 - Mid-tempo power chord-based plodding  rocker. 
23.  Time Remains In Central Position	1:50 - Steady and  familiar-sounding strumming mid-tempo jangler with  a bit of a messy ending. 
24.  End It With Light	 1:11 - Uptempo and insistent machine-gun riffs for the big little (brief) end. Imagine all the stage backlighting behind Robert Pollard for this epic crashing finale.
