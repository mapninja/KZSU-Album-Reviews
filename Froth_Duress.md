General Comments / Release Notes  

Droning, trancy shoegaze pop songs with great little sonic touches. Echoes of American Analogue and Cocteau Twins, here and there.

Bandcamp Release Notes: "After a two-year hiatus, Froth is back with their most fully realized work to date, ​Duress. Co-produced with longtime friend and collaborator Tomas Dolas (Oh Sees/Mr. Elevator) at his analog-focused Studio 22 in Cypress Park, CA, the record is unapologetically experimental yet undeniably accessible - combining some of the band’s strongest hooks with left-field sounds and unexpected flourishes of electronica. Joo Joo Ashworth has matured into a talented producer in his own right, communicating his singular vision through studio technique as much as his angular, Verlaine-inspired guitar sound. As always, the rhythm section of Jeremy Katz and Cameron Allen displays a tightness and sense of mutual understanding only achieved through years of friendship and extensive touring.

Tracks:  
1. **** Laurel 03:15	- Starts off brilliantly with this droning, midtempo, Jesus & Mary Chain like shoegazer. Killer atonal guitar hooks and solos.  
2. *** Catalog 03:51	- Buzz and feedback give way to a great breathy. trancy, shoegaze pop pleaser.  
3. *** Dialogue 03:59 - Distant, lofi sounding intro breaks into another pleasant, breathy droner. "unsettling George Harrison on a bad acid trip" guitar is the highlight of this one.  
4. *** a2 05:05 - Mid to uptempo, driving mostly instrumental rocker with it's hair hanging down in it's face. Words at about 4:30, but they mostly stay out of the way.    
5. *** Department Head 04:50 - Nice little shuffling danceable rhythm, remains clocklike as buzzing guitars come in. Airy and pleasant.  
6. 77 03:06 - Atmospheric and electronic. Breathy female vocals floating in the upper background.  
7. John Peel Slowly 02:08	- Slow, light, electronic and cavernous. Instrumental with Harold Budd style piano.  
8. *** Xvanos 05:46 - Very American Analogue Set. Midtempo, brief, spare  lyrics. Cool song.   
9. Slow Chamber 04:26 - Slow, jangly, breathy and cathedralesque like Spiritualized.  
10. Syndrome 04:48 - Buzzy drum machine and ethereal guitars lend to a Cocoteau Twins vibe.
