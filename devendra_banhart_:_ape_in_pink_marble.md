Reviewer: DJ Stace

His ninth studio album. Stays in his comfort zone with dreamy easy listening folk pop. Kicks into a little funk territory halfway through. Plenty of good music, here. This is your Autumn beach album.

1.	"Middle Names" **** 3:28 Lovely little lament. Finger-picked guitar with ethereal noise, behind. Reminds me of Kings of Convenience.
2.	"Good Time Charlie" 2:06 Pretty Weenish little tune. Brief, but good.
3.	"Jon Lends a Hand" ** 2:33 The album begins to pick up pace with this tune. Another lovely little ditty, repeats "As beautiful as you" to the end. 
4.	"Mara" *** 3:13 Wacky flamenco-ish flourish moves into a mid tempo, bass heavy, space folk head bobber.
5.	"Fancy Man" ***** 	2:29 His delivery reminds me a little of Gary Numan, a little. The arrangement, too, or maybe Grace Jones with it's precise little funk riff. Up-tempo, for Banhart. My  favorite on the album. 
6.	"Fig in Leather" 3:13 Another easy listening folk funk tongue-in-cheek toe tapper.
7.	"Theme for a Taiwanese Woman in Lime Green" **** 4:23 Bravely and competently strolling through some Getz and Gilberto territory, here. Mid-tempo Lounge Folk. 
8.	"Souvenirs" 2:59 Somber, muted strummed guitar and low keyboard that asserts itself in the middle and 
9.	"Mourner's Dance"  	3:18 More Organ and vocal folk with a cool little Guzheng-style flourishes. Somber.
10.	"Saturday Night"  ****	4:23 I really like this soulful little folk ballad. Upbeat (again, for Banhart). Muted keyboard, throughout and a groovy little pattering rhythm.
11.	"Linda" *** 5:56 Slow, quiet bluesy folk about being invisible (socially). Nice bassline and wavy soft guitar solos. Crawls to a near stop at about 3:00 with somewhat uncomfortably long pauses. It actually makes you a little anxious. Comes back at about 4:30 and finishes soft.
12.	"Lucky" *** 	2:49 Lazy soft folk rock love song. He pulls off a pretty high level of sappiness, here. 
13.	"Celebration" 	2:56 Soft, pleasant, floating guitars. Very nearly instrumental. Repeats the only lyric "Celebration." Probably a great song to fall asleep to.
