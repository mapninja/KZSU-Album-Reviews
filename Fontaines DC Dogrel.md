!!!ATTENTION PROLETARIAT OF THE GIG ECONOMY! YOUR ANTHEMS HAVE ARRIVED AND THEY ARE PURE, PREMIUM F&%$ING ROCK&ROLL!!!

Insistent, confrontational, nearly old-school post-punk. 

Lead singer is Ian Curtis, but with optimism and the brash confidence of Shane McGowan. 

FCCs: None, nada 

RIYL: Shame, IDLES, The Strokes, Wire, Killing Joke, Little Richard, The Clash, Pogues, perfectly executed rock songs,... hearing the next big thing, first. 

Play: all of them. Can't stop listening to #8, #9 & #10

1.	"Big"	1:46 - Uptempo, jangling, angry, rilling, kicking angry defiant and declarative. A love song to Dublin. "But, I'm Gonna Be Big!" Yes, young man, you are.  
2.	"Sha Sha Sha"	2:32 - Bouncy, driving and catchy. Wire-esque.
3.	"Too Real"	4:08 - Uptempo, urgent, repetetive and brilliant. Almost R.E.M.-like at first, but then it's all in. Chaotic, panning Sonic Youth guitars over driving beat. "I'm about to make alot o' money... Is it too real 4 ya?"  
4.	"Television Screens"	4:00 - Uptempo, jangly. If Joy Dividion had made happy sounding songs. 
5.	"Hurricane Laughter"	4:51 - Uptempo, driving, trancey, repetetive, baddass droning rock&roll. Fantastic Jim Morrison-narrative growling lyrical styling. 
6.	"Roy's Tune"	3:00 - Slow to Midtempo, strumming, sad and great. 
7.	"The Lotts"	4:57 - Could easily be a late 80's Cure tune. Mid-tempo, quiet, lamenting and melancholy. Fantastic and dense lyrics.
8.	**** "Chequeless Reckless"	2:16 - Droning and authoritative uptempo venting. Wire comes to mind. "Money,... is the sandpit of the soul." Greatness.
9.	**** "Liberty Belle"	2:32 - The car commercial song and I mean that in th ebest way possible, but I swear to god you'll hear it in a VW ad, eventually. This song was built in a lab to be played while driving 80 MPH down 280 on a Sunday with noone else on the road. Young, fast, sleek, crashing, all f*&^ing in rock&roll. 
10. ****	"Boys in the Better Land"	5:00 - Uptempo, tamborine-laden galloping, swaggering deep-throated wall-of sound, anthemic, everything but the kitchen sink perfection
11.	"Dublin City Sky"	4:53 - Another love song to Dublin and a clear nod to the likes of Shane McGowan and the Pogues. Slow tempo traditional sounding Irish rock dirge.
