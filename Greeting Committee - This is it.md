The debut album from Kansas City high-school rockers The Greeting Committee sounds like a polished, well-written follow up album. Mature and well-orchestrated, with Addie Sardino's confident and soulful vocals leading infectious indie-pop of the type you might expect from veterans like Spoon. Big band accompaniments with brass and R&B backups as well as great toe-tapping songs make this a fantastic listen. 

FCCs: Track 9 "Pissed away your life..." for those on the cautious side?

RIYL: Alabama Shakes, Spoon, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, The Strokes

Play: Anything; Favorites: 2,2,2,1,9(see FCC note),7,12 did I mention track 2?

1. Is This It? 2:47 ** - Short, krauty Sax-riffs with staccato drum rhythm starts this one off. Mid-tempo. Addie's vocals in full ethereal power on the chorus. 

2. Pull It Together 3:39 ***** - See all those stars? It's almost a shame this album wasn't released during the summer, as this is one of those perfect summer hits that just takes over and catapults a band into stardom. Just play it. Trust me, you'll be hooked from the first notes of the Samba-like piano riff that holds together this mid-tempo, booty-shaking, feel-good perfect pop song. I dare you to be still while it's playing. 

3. Some Kind of Love 3:11 ** - Light and airy, with piano trills and hand-claps. Lovely mid-tempo tune that skips along underneath her breathy vocals. Love the trumpet solo. 

4. You've Got Me 3:39 *** - Starts off with full brass, like a great Sharon Jones joint you never heard before. More great vocalization from the 19 year old who is going to blow people away over the next few years. Great, classic R&B backup singers close it out, too. 

5. 17 3:39 *** - The single. Bouncy, confident, brash, in your face. Just like a 17 year old. Apparently about cross legal lines love affairs? Great tune with a great refrain. 

6. More 3:40 - Smokey, piano bar beginning, gives way to midtempo, emphatic pop-rock anthem. Soaring chorus vocals again highlight the real strength of this band's sound. 

7. Run for Your Money 3:02 *** - Another bouncey, uptempo light pop-rocker. Great chorus and refrains. 

8. Gold Star 2:13 - Midtempo, guitar reminds me a little of bossa nova in it's tone. Lamenting without dragging. 

9. Flint 3:48 - (FCC alarmists, note: "pissed away your whole life...")

10. Odds of Forever 3:41 - Cool guitar effect at the beginning that makes me think of another song I can't think of the name of, now. Uptempo, simple, bright, bouncey. With strings. 

11. Birthday Song 3:08 *** - Great, acoustic, quiet, heartbreaking. About a shitty 8th birthday party and beyond, where the parents are breaking up and the kids knows something is wrong and noone talks about it. Poignant, lovely. 

12. Don't Go 4:06 *** - A final, uptempo, bouncing, perfect pop-rocker with strumming guitars and a rock solid rhythm. Another of their singles, I think.
