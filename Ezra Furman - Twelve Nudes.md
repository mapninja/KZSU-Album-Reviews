General Comments / Release Notes  

In your face, fast frenetic punk/pop with trans life, gender, transitioning (in more than just gender) as central themes. Sonically, lyrically and existentially, this is an important record. Brutally honest and not at all interested in your delicate sensibilities or propriety. Also, just goddamned entertaining as hell. This is what Rock & Rock is for. 

FCCs: 1,9,10,11

RIYL: 

Play: 2,3,4,5,6,7

Tracks:  
1. Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone 02:22 - FCC "Shit" Too bad, too, because this song is incredible. Urgent, fast with woo-woos and everything.   
2. ** Evening Prayer aka Justice 02:55	- Nice insistent acoustic power chording at the intro. Furman's scream-sing is fantastic, and one of the best in rock, I think. Mid-uptempo straight ahead rock&roll with razor sharp edges, vocally, musically and lyrically.  
3. ** Transition From Nowhere 03:11	- Soft vocal intro of Furman's warbly almost falsetto gives way to the gravel croon quickly. Great song with challenging lyrics.   
4. ** Rated R Crusaders 02:16	 - Machine gun krauty fuzz guitar. Uptempo, frenetic noisy and great. Goes low-fi and tinny at 1:37, stays that way to the end. Cool track.  
5. *** Trauma (03:07) - Like Melvins doing country rock. Epic, chunky power-chords and furious lyrics. More awesome.  
6. *** Thermometer (02:05)	- Uptempo, Twee-punk anthemic and killer. Who knew the word "Thermometer" was such a great chorus. Reminds me of some of the Japanese girlband stuff, like Otoboke Beaver and Shonen Knife.  
7. *** I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend (03:29) - The single. Not the best track on the album, but those have FCCs, so this is the one we can play. That said, it's a great song, on it's own. Playfull, off kilter and very 50's-60's teen love song sounding. With a twist.  
8. ** Blown (00:55) - Brief, noisy, fast, aggressive punk.  
9. My Teeth Hurt 02:31 - FCC "Fuck" - Both a song about getting your teeth worked on, also a metaphor for gender dysphoria. Killer song. Too bad about the FCC.   
10. In America (02:10) - FCC "Shit" - Another great tune with an FCC.   
11. What Can You Do But Rock n Roll (02:33) - FCC "Fuck" - Another killer track. Fast, angry, insistent, punk anthem.
