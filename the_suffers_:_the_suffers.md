Riding the wave of Neo-Soul big band sound outfits like Sharon Jones, Alabama Shakes, etc... The Suffers bring their "Gulf Coast Soul" with big production and big sound that floats easily from big brassy Dap Kings territory to reggae. This is a great record. Kam Franklin's voice is bold and competent, at time reminding me of Gladys Knight at her young best.

Favorites: Any, but try: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7

1. Make Some Room ***** 4:34	She really loves him, and wants to make him some dinner. A Daptone-style mid-tempo opening with great brass, behind it and a sense of humor. My favorite.
2. Dutch 3:22 - Big guitar and brass opening tones it down. Nice fluttering brass at the chorus.
3. Midtown ***** 4:41 Rollercoaster ride. Strong rimshot mid-tempo rhythm give way to driving up-temp rocker at the choruses. Love her voice on this one.
4. Slow It Down ***** 3:09 Uptempo, brassy, Reggae romp with a bit of a Blood, Sweat & Tears sound in the horn intro and flourishes. 
5. Gwan **** 3:52 Powerfully delivered fast and naughty little rocker. Goin' al night night. 
6. Better 5:14 		
7. Good Day **** 4:12	Another up-tempo with Caribbean rhythm & flair.		
8. Stay 3:37 Kam gets a little Sade, here, and mixed with her gravel, it works great. Nice little strumming, Caribbean, mid-tempo love plea.
9. Giver **** 7:10	 Straight up soul slow jam baby-don't-leave greatness. "Lemme just massage your back..." Old-school sax solo at 4:20ish.
10. Peanuts 4:01	Really pushing into Gladys Knight territory here. A great mid-tempo, soul handclapper. A good strong brassy finish.
