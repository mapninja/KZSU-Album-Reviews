True DIY spirit, here, this band hails from Philly and their debut sounds straight out of the 70's. Glam, Punk, Metal, it's all in there. Tina Halliday's "I don't give a fuck" attitude comes right through her fantastic Brian Johnson trapped in a schoolgirl growling vocals. This is a fantastic debut record full of everything that was great about 70's rock. Everything is catchy as hell, packed chock full of great riffs and musical competence. Play anything, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLAY TRACK 4 OVER AND OVER!!! 

FCC Clean!!

RIYL: The Sweet, ACDC, The Jam, Thin Lizzy, L7, Babes in Toyland

1. Meet Me in the Street (3:11) - ACDC anyone? Killer opening riff, upbeat, straight ahead rock&roll song. This ought to be the Anti-facist movement's theme music.  
2. Need to Feel Your Love (4:01) - Upbeat, energetic love song, with Halliday's growling vocals giving it the edge that the accompaniment can't muster. Guitar reminds me a bit of The Fixx, actually, but not in a bad way. 
3. Just Can't Get Enough (2:51) - Pop with enough edge to make it cool. Upbeat, aggressive love song with a bit of jangle. 
4. Expect the Bayonet (3:45)************ - OH MY GOD JUST PLAY THIS SONG OVER AND OVER! This song would feel right at home on a Jam album. Angsty, infectious groove with that Jam-style punchiness that makes it aggressive as hell without the harshness of metal fuzz. Halliday's best vocal's on the album, too. This is this year's theme song. "If you don't give us the ballot, expect the bayonet!" FYI, at 1:58 someone coughs in the background, betraying the truly DIY nature of this recording. It's actually a little bit endearing.  
5. Rank and File (2:55) - Thin Lizzy Lives! Drinking and rocking out song. Killer riffs, great beat. 
6. Turn It Up (3:59) - Killer riffs, a la Judas Priest's "You've Got Another Thing Comin'." Tina is here to rock out and have fun, and she's not having any of your bullshit. Fun guitar solo for your air guitar cravings.
7. Suffer Me (4:04) - Guitar gets a bit proggy, maybe think Paul Simon's Graceland album guitar, but with distortion. This song has got a strangely catchy shuffling beat and, of course, Tina Halliday's badass vocals. 
8. Pure Desire (3:30) - Plodding bass hook at the front end, with more of those "The Fixx" guitar riffs, but it works. Halliday's vocals with slightly less venom, here, but still the focal point of the tune. I have no idea wihy this song makes me picture line-dancing skinheads, but there you go, for what it's worth. Upbeat and catchy.
9. Until You Find the One (1:54) - Just guitar and vocals. Lament about being the girlfriend who's "not the one." Brief, but likeable. 
10. Milk and Honey (4:19) - Can't put my finger quite on who this song reminds me of, but Big Star is a candidate, for sure. Sounds like a drive down PCH, with the window down and your arm out doing that aerodynamic thing. Medium tempo jangler. 
11. Can't Play it Cool (3:48) - More Thin Lizzy goodness. 
12. (Say Goodbye To) Sophie Scholl (4:17) - Another Big Star tune, musically, centered around one of the leaders of the White Rose Nazi resitance movement.
