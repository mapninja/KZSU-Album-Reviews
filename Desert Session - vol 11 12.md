General Comments:  
The desert rock & roll circus, finally returns. Vast and fragmentary, quirky and familiar. Homme's curation is, as always, spot on. A killer eclectic collection/sampler from the beating heart of Desert Rock, Rancho de la Luna. 

Release Notes:   
Ending a 16-year hiatus since its last installment, the most mythical, longest running rock n roll mixtape odyssey in existence, Desert Sessions will return this October with the most ambitious entries yet in its expansive and elusive catalog: Vols. 11 & 12 (a/k/a respectively as Arrivederci Despair and Tightwads & Nitwits & Critics & Heels)...

Tracks:  
1. **FCC "SHIT"** Move Together 5:03 - (lead vocal: Billy F. Gibbons) - Midtempo weirdo-rock jam session. About 2 minutes of Billy Gibbons falsetto and wonky electronic rhythm, before all hell breaks loose with Homme's Godzilla riffage and a pots and pans chaotic drum breakdown. Shifts gears several times. Gets very Eagles (the 70's ones, not EODM) at about 3:40, then takes on a familiar sleazy Them Crooked Vultures beat to a drum breakdown fadeout. Killer. Play the Radio Edit, below.  
2. ***** Noses in Roses Forever 5:33 - (lead vocal: Joshua Homme) - Classic uptempo QOTSA ass-shaking spacerock. Desert Sessions tunes have a habit of finding their way onto subsequent QOTSA albums, and this is the likely culprit. Cool robotic buzzy lead space guitar soloing, throughout. Rhythm shifts at about 1:45 and turns surfy.  Cool, production shifts throughout, riffing on the same melody. Soundtrack for the next Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Great song.   
3. **** Far East for the Trees 4:52 - Midtempo desert spacerock spaghetti western instrumental. Killer galloping rhythm and sitarish guitars. Sounds like a great Brant Bjork jam.   
4. ***** If You Run 4:00 - (lead vocal: Libby Grace) - Dark brooding Appalachian folk acoustic start with atmospheric guitar feedback and build to Led Zep worthy crashing epic guitar solo battle for Middle Earth ending . Beautiful vocals. Has a She Keeps Bees vibe. Great song.    
5. **** Crucifire 1:44 - (lead vocal: Mike Kerr) - Fast, insistent desert punk ala EODM. Killer Velveeta cheesey backup vocals.    
6. *** Chic Tweetz 3:47 - (vocals: Töôrnst Hülpft, Matt Berry) - Goofy, Weenesque weirdo rock from Lapland. I don't know what to say about this one. Give it a listen before you play it cold. Dorky, potty-humorish, though surprisingly FCC clean. If EODM were lead by the flamboyant lovechild of Liberace and that German commander from Inglorious Basterds. Song ends abruptly at 3:20 and gives way to some helium driven nonsensical patter between Hülpft and the recording crew, which is funny, but not a song.  
7. **FCC "FUCKING"** Something You Can’t See 3:26 - (lead vocal: Jake Shears) -  Cool 70's midtempo beachrock groove. Has a nice airiness to it. Good song for driving through the desert with the windows or top down. I had to look at the credits to prove to myself it wasn't a Hanni El Khatib colab. Killer tune, play the radio edit, below.    
8. **FCC "FUCKING"** Easier Said Than Done  3:06 - (lead vocal: Joshua Homme) - Homme's trademark tone poem desert rock opera anthem. Sounds like a continuation of something you've heard before on a QOTSA or TCV album. Starts with a metronomic rhythm and piano/space organ accomp. Great vocals and lyrics. Last 25 seconds builds and rocks a little to an abrupt ending.  Play the radio edit, below.
